# Aircraft Detection-YOLO11
I’ve been running a fun experiment on identifying different airplane models. I’ve always been fascinated by aircrafts, but most of my friends can’t tell one model from another. So I decided to build a custom model that can recognize various airplane types. I collected around 2,000 images and trained it using YOLO V11L.

# Here are some results!
